        competitive online game that blends the speed and intensity of an RTS
        with <br>RPG elements. Two teams of powerful champions, each with a
        unique design and playstyle, battle head-to-head <br>across
        multiple battlefields and game modes. With an ever-expanding roster of
        champions, frequent updates and <br>a thriving tournament scene, League
        of Legends offers endless replayability for players of every skill level.</p>
