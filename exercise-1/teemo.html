    <header><h1>TEEMO</h1><p>THE SWIFT SCOUT</p></header>
    <main>
      <p>Teemo is a legend among his yordle brothers and sisters in Bandle City.
         As far as yordles are concerned, there is something just slightly off
         about him. While Teemo enjoys the companionship of other yordles, he
         also insists on frequent solo missions in the ongoing defense of Bandle
         City. Despite his genuinely warm personality, something switches off
         inside Teemo's mind during combat so that the lives he must end while
         on patrol do not burden him. Even as a young recruit, the drill instructors
          and other trainees found it a little disconcerting that, while Teemo
          was normally charming and kind, he turned deadly serious and highly
          efficient the minute combat exercises began. Teemo's superiors quickly
          steered him toward the Scouts of the Mothership, which is one of Bandle
           City's most distinguished Special Forces unit alongside the Megling
           Commandos.</p>

      <p>While most yordles do not handle solo scouting missions with a great
        deal of finesse, Teemo is remarkably efficient at them. His record of
        success in defending Bandle City from infiltrators easily makes him one
        of the most dangerous yordles alive, though you'd never know it by having
        a cup of honey mead with him at his favorite inn. His signature weapon -
        a blowgun - uses a rare ajunta poison he personally gathers from the jungles
        of Kumungu. To help cope with his lengthy periods of isolation, Teemo
        recently struck up a friendship with Tristana, a fellow member of Bandle
         City's Special Forces. Teemo is a pint-sized foe that many have come to
         fear and whose small size belies his fearsome resolve.</p>
